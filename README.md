### Final project of "getting and cleaning data"
#### repository contents
this reposoitory contains the following items
- `readme.md`
- `codebook.md` : describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data
- `run_analysis.R` : the R script to read, merge and clean up the data
- `tidy_data.txt` : the final tidy dataset.

#### workflow

download the data from the following address:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

unzip the contents, and change your working directory to the following folder within the data package:
`UCI HAR Dataset`

The R script does the following steps:
- loading the required libraries
- reading in the data
- merging the training and test sets
- extracting mean and std from merged data
- adding descriptive activity names
- adding descriptive variable names
- removing unnecessary objects from memory
- creating an independent tidy dataset with mean of each variable calculated
- writing the tidy data to a file called `tidy_data.txt`
